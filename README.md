<p>Food Based Monitoring System build with a BlockChain concept</p>


<p>The food productive chain is a very important sector within the global production system. Specifically, food production has peculiar characteristics, that involves since the making and production of a product to the several effects provided by this product in a public health enviroment</p>

<p>In this context, the main goal of this project is to create a monitoring/tracking system prototype in Python, of the food production sector utilizing a blockchain concept, allowing a safer and better storage of the data </p>

<h2>How BlockChain Works</h2>

<p>Basically, BlockChain is a decentralized system of recording information(kind of a database) in a way that makes it difficult or almost impossiple to change, hac ou cheat the system.</p>

<p>A blockchain is essentially a digital book of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number os transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's book.</p>


<p>But how is BlockChain so safety?</p>
<p>Well, each block in the chain contains an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash. And every block is linked to the previous one through this hash. If something happens with the data of the block, the hash is immediatly changed, and now, all the blocks linked are no long valid, which means that if someone wants to corrupt a Block, he would have to change each and every block in the chain.</p>
